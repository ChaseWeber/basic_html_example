				<h3>Country-Town</h3>
				<p>We provide services to busy areas as well as areas far from the grid. Here we provided a 40 GW supply of "free" energy for the people in this remote area. This supplied their houses with electricity so they could be warm in the winter and cool in the summmer.</p>

				<h3>TDB - They Do Business</h3>
				<p>Providing businesses with a chance to save money makes us excited. It may be scary to invest in such a new feature; however within 10 years, you are surely to pay off the initial investment! If you have a flat top, see what we've done in the past!</p>

				<h3>AB - Also Business</h3>
				<p>Also Business is a great example of what we have achieved through the use of window based solar capture systems. This company was able to reduce their electricity costs by 80% each month. WOW what a save!</p>

				<h3>Greatly Industrial Inc.</h3>
				<p>Although this company is made up, you may not realize that industrial plants can benefit from these panels. In this case, electrical costs were reduced by 30%. That is a lot considering how much power the pumps in this plant take.</p>

				<h3>Parks Are Cool</h3>
				<p>Introducing green energy in public areas is a great way to educate the populous. Parks Are Cool, allowed us to install some solar panels in the middle of a lake. Since installation, the surrounding town has increased purchases by 500%!!! We are not complaining and neither are out clients.</p>
